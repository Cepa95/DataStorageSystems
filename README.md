## Seminar Tasks
1. Create a database with approximately 10 tables.
2. Populate the database with data.
3. Create a data warehouse with one fact table and at least 4 dimensions.
4. One of the dimensions should be `dimDate` or `dimDateTime`.
5. Dimension tables should have surrogate keys.
6. Programmatically populate the time dimension.
7. Implement change tracking for one of the dimensions using Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD), supporting both SCD Type 1 and SCD Type 2.
8. Create an SSIS package for loading one of the dimensions with data from two or three tables using Merge Join. The package should support incremental load.
9. Create a package that loads the fact table and uses lookups to find surrogate keys.
10. Create two queries to display aggregated data from the data warehouse.
